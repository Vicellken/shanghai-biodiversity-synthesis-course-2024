# Shanghai Biodiversity Synthesis course 2024

For the lecture and tutorial on biodiversity metrics today, please come with
your laptop. To work through the exercises together, Rstudio (or another similar
editor) will make your life easier. Please also install the following R packages:
tidyverse (for ggplot2, and other data wrangling packages and functions), mobr,
and mobsim, and cowplot (for combining ggplot objects). We'll likely also discuss
other widely used packages for diversity metrics, such as vegan, and betapart.
