# Shangai Biodiversity Synthesis course 2024 - course notes

### what is biodiversity, how to measure it?

- species richness
- how species are evolutionary related => a concept of phylogenetic diversity?
- as a summary variable to one or a few numbers, calculated from the sampling pool => not the 'truth' but a summary on the subset of the 'truth'
- generally, think about what the "number" is, and how to get it => packages can be meaningless until people know what numbers of parameters to be put into
